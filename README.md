# 1 Guess the Number Game
This is a simple Python game where the user has to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program will provide hints such as "too high" or "too low" until the user guesses the correct number.

# About this project

# ```Guess the Number Game in Python```
This is a simple Python program that allows the user to play a number guessing game. The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess the number. The user has a total of 3 moves to guess the number correctly. If the user's guess matches the computer's number, the user wins the game, and the program prints "Correct Answer". If the user's guess is incorrect, the program prints "incorrect Answer", and the user loses one move. If the user is unable to guess the number correctly within the 3 moves, the game is over, and the program prints "Game Over For you MR. {userName}" along with the correct answer.

This program can be used as a basic introduction to Python programming concepts such as user input, random number generation, conditional statements, and loops.

# 2 Simple Chatbot

This is a simple Python program that uses natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user input. The chatbot can answer basic questions and carry out simple tasks such as setting reminders or providing weather information.

# About this project

# ```Simple Chat Bot project for beginners```

This is a simple Python program that demonstrates the basics of building a chatbot. The program starts by asking the user for their name and stores it in the nameOfUser variable. The chatbot has pre-defined responses to a few questions, which are stored in questionOne, answerOne, questionTwo, and answerTwo variables.

The program then takes user input as a question and checks if it matches any of the pre-defined questions. If the user asks "what is My Name?", the chatbot responds with the user's name. If the user asks "what is you Name?", the chatbot responds with the developer's name. If the user asks about "Noun", "Verb", or "Pronoun", the chatbot provides a simple definition of the terms. If the user's question does not match any of the pre-defined questions, the chatbot responds with "Data not included yet" and suggests the user try one of the pre-defined topics.

This program can be used as a simple introduction to Python programming concepts such as user input, variables, conditional statements, and basic string manipulation.
